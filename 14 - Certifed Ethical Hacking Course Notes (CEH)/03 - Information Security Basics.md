Information Security Basics
===========================

Security Triangle

	• Security - Less functionality and more complexity
	• Ease of Use - Less security and generally less functionality.
	• Functionality - Less security and not as easy to use

Types of Attacks

Passive (sniffing)
Active (DoS)

	• Close-in (dumpster diving)
	• Insider Attacks (key loggers)
	• Distribution Attacks (supply chain)
	
Cyber Kill Chain (Cyber Attack Lifecycle)

Model developed by Lockheed Martin that describes the stages of a targeted malware attack.

	1. Reconnaissance
	2. Weaponization
	3. Delivery
	4. Exploitation
	5. Installation
	6. Command & Control
	7. Actions on Objectives
	
TTPs

	• Tactics
	• Techniques
	• Procedures
	
Indication of Compromise (IoC)

	• Email
	• Network
	• Host-based
	• Behaviour
	
Default Security Settings

	• Fail Secure (fail closed)
	• Fail Insecure (fail open)
	
Hacking Methodology

	1. Recon 90%
	2. Scanning
	3. Gain Access
	4. Maintain Access
	5. Post-Attack Phase (Clearing Tracks)

Testing Types

	• Internal Penetration Testing
	• External Penetration Test
	• Targeted Penetration Testing
	• Announced test - Users know a test taking place
	
Testing Classifications

	• Black Box (Blind Test) - We know nothing
	• Grey Box - Knowledge of an average user
	• White Box - Know everything
	• Unannounced - The limited people know of the test taking place
	• Double-Blind Test - You know nothing about the target, and the target is unaware you will be testing
	
Defence in Depth

	• Independent tiers of defence
	• People
	• Data
	• Applications
	• Hosts
	• Internal Networks
	• Public-facing Networks (perimeter)
	• Physical
	• Policies, Procedures, Awareness & Education
